Its nickname Rain City was earned due to Seattle's Oceanic climate: rainy winters but relatively dry, mild summers. A popular port city in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle sits on an isthmus between Lake Washington and the Puget Sound, which connects to the Pacific Ocean. Seattle has a population of over 650 ,000 and a metro-area population of 3.6 million. The Olympia National Forest is to the west, while the Canadian border is only 100 miles north. Besides coffee and rain, Seattle's also known for being the birthplace of grunge as well as Jimi Hendrix, who is buried here.\n",

Its nickname Rain City was earned due to Seattle's Oceanic climate: rainy winters but relatively dry, mild summers. A popular port city in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle sits on an isthmus between Lake Washington and the Puget Sound, which connects to the Pacific Ocean. Seattle has a population of over 650&nbsp;,000 and a metro-area population of 3.6 million. The Olympia National Forest is to the west, while the Canadian border is only 100 miles north. Besides coffee and rain, Seattle's also known for being the birthplace of grunge as well as Jimi Hendrix, who is buried here.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWho's There?\\u003C\\u002Fstrong\\u003E\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHome to the University of Washington, Seattle has a student population of more than 40&nbsp;,000 students at UW alone. Seattle is an expansive, diverse city with a little bit of everyone from hipster, upwardly mobile young professionals and families to retirees, and almost 60 percent of adults living in Seattle have earned bachelor's degrees. The city's biggest employers are Boeing, Microsoft, University of Washington and Amazon.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat's Around Seattle?\\u003C\\u002Fstrong\\u003E\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere's something for everyone in Seattle's many neighborhoods that lie in its 13 districts. Capitol Hill is a vibrant 'hood filled with nightlife and restaurants, Sunset Hill is serene and green, Fremont is popular with the creative crowd and Alki is a laidback, beachfront utopia.&nbsp;Seattle's many bike lanes and city-wide bike racks make it a city cyclists love, and if you can handle the hills, it's also walkable. The city is serviced by its King County Metro Transit buses, but owning a car is certainly beneficial as you can explore everything the region has to offer.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat Do You Do In Seattle?\\u003C\\u002Fstrong\\u003E\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFrom catching a Seahawks football game and grabbing food in Chinatown to perusing the Seattle Art Museum and exploring one of the city's 26 parks, there's so much to do in Seattle.
