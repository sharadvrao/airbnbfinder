# AirbnbFinder: A Powerful Airbnb Recommendation Engine

**Overview** A platform that greatly simplifies the process of locating an Airbnb property in Seattle. Airbnbâ€™s current design requires the user to enter very granular information and potentially search through hundreds of listings. AirbnbFinder presents a streamlined approach which allows the user to enter flexible search criteria, indicate relative preferences, and incorporate relevance feedback information. 

**Data** The design utilizes data from Inside Airbnb, a publicly available raw dataset of Airbnb properties from multiple markets. The data was prepared using techniques including NLP, categorical encoding, and standardization.

**Modeling** At the heart of AirbnbFinder is a content based recommendation engine. Preferences are quantified then used to construct a cosine similarity-based measure of the 20 most alike properties. The user is given the opportunity to select preferred properties and this information is used to further refine the search results.
