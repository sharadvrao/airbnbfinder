The calendar is always up to date, so if you're Airbnb-verified, you can book immediately with Instant Booking.  Otherwise, drop me a note and let me know a little about yourself and why you're coming to Seattle. Here's more... This is a private bedroom and private bathroom in a condo, just off Pike Street.  An ideal hotel alternative:  the best in comfort, price, and location -- a half block east of the Central Business District that includes the Convention Center, a 7-minute walk from the Westlake Light Rail link to/from the airport, a block south of the Pike Pine Corridor which encompasses the Retail Shopping Core, and a block west of Capitol Hill, Seattle</td>\n",

If you can't find parking on the street right in front of the building when you arrive, you might want to take your luggage up to the condo before looking for a space.  The parking permit will be on the desk in your room, along with a map showing all Zone 21 parking spaces.  Once parked, you can stay there for 72 hours before you need to move your car to another Zone 21 space. Parking is on a first-come, first-served basis, but since I moved here in 1998, I've usually been able to find a space within a couple blocks of the building, but on certain times, like evenings, Saturday nights and Sundays, I've had to venture further out in the neighborhood.

All the food and drinks in your private little food alcove are complimentary, so help yourself to what's been called The World’s First Free Mini Bar.

Hold onto the keys and, if you drive, return the parking permit when you check out.  The lobby key fob has a $50 replacement cost imposed by the homeowners association that I must pass on to you, should you lose it.

       "22    The Ballard Neighborhood is a great place to visit:  *10 minute walk to downtown Ballard with fabulous bars and restaurants, great Sunday farmers market, nice three-screen cinema, and much more.  *5 minute walk to the Ballard Locks, where ships enter and exit Puget Sound from Seattle waterways.  *10 minute drive to downtown Seattle.  Buses also run regularly downtown from close by - either to downtown Seattle or to the University District and elsewhere. Evenings are very quiet here and the air quality is unusually good for a city. We get a fresh sea breeze off of Puget Sound in the early evening. Guests find the cottage a calming and refreshing refuge from the bustle of the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Don't hesitate to give me a shout. (I have a secret restaurant list that I share with my guests upon request :-) ) The house is close to a large shopping center plus a bunch of cool dining options.

So if jogging or leisurely strolls are your thing, you'll want to check out Lincoln Park, Fauntleroy Park and Westcrest Park (all within a mile and a half).                                                                                                  \n",

       "8448  With its residential vibe and fantastic location, Lower Queen Anne is the perfect home base for a Seattle getaway. It’s within walking distance of all the famous things to do - but not so close that you’re surrounded by Downtown crowds! The Museum of Pop Culture, the Pacific Science Center, the KeyArena, the Chihuly Garden & Glass, and the iconic Space Needle are all just a 5-minute walk from my place. Don’t miss these world-class attractions! You won’t be hungry for long in this neighborhood… Either grab groceries at the Safeway (6-minute walk) or pop into The Other Coast Cafe for a sandwich. John Nielsen Pastries also has some of the best baked goods in town. And once you’ve worked an appetite for something heartier, Lower Queen Anne is home to many mouthwatering places to eat. I love Toulouse Petit (flavorful Creole cuisine) and Boat Street Kitchen (cute French place). Feeling healthy? Broadfork Cafe serves veggie-focused fare. Then you can walk off your meal at the Olympic Sculptur   \n",

       "2     My personal favorite places to dine are:  • Marination Station - Alki (beautiful view, plus delicious Hawaiian /Korean style food, for example kimchi fried rice and pork sliders) • Wild Ginger - Downtown - Asian infusion. • Westward - Wallingford - Pricey but the food is great and the view and bonfire pits are spectacular... for those non raining days...lol. • The Pink Door - Belltown/Downtown - Pricey Italian - ariel performances some nights and great food, considered a romantic spot... reservations are most likely needed. • Lunchbox - South Lake Union - Burgers and such. • Proletariat - White Center - Near my place! Great pizza! They even have discounted happy hour pizza. • Giannoni's Pizza - West Seattle - 4 blocks from my place. Great pizza by the slice or whole, plus salads, and some great hot sandwiches. The Spinach Rustica is my fave! VENUES:  • Nectar - Fremont - great shows every weekend, pay at door. • The Moore - downtown - usually ticket holders to concerts/comedy and such.   \n",

       "5     Free Zone 21 Parking.  There are 60 blocks in a 10 x 7-block radius of the building with 200+ spaces for free Zone 21 parking.  If you can't find parking on the street right in front of the building when you arrive, you might want to take your luggage up to the condo before looking for a space.  The parking permit will be on the desk in your room, along with a map showing all Zone 21 parking spaces.  Once parked, you can stay there for 72 hours before you need to move your car to another Zone 21 space. Parking is on a first-come, first-served basis, but since I moved here in 1998, I've usually been able to find a space within a couple blocks of the building, but on certain times, like evenings, Saturday nights and Sundays, I've had to venture further out in the neighborhood.  With a little (sometimes a lot) of patience, I've seldom had to resort to parking in a pay lot.   If you plan to be using your car a lot and going in and out more than, say, once a day -- sorry, but it'd be more c   \n",

       "17    No smoking (of any kind) in the house, due to our family's allergies. The house has one bathroom: The house's inhabitants (and all of our bladders) are happiest and most harmonious when showers are quick (or when we give each other a heads up before taking a long, luxurious bath in our big old clawfoot tub). No pets please, due to the fact that we have active and unpredictable young children (our own and sometimes even younger children visiting for an afternoon). You'll know you're staying with kids. Our sons love interacting with guests: They'll be eager to get to know you, chatter with you, and play with you. If you are at home during the day, you will be surrounded by toys… on your way to the kitchen, to the bathroom, to the dining room table. Toys are part of our world. You'll know you are staying with a family. There will be play dates with loud laughter, running, shrieking and music playing (think toy whistles and keyboards that play nursery rhymes, the joy). There will be grown    \n",

Also, be aware that this is a urban environment. This condo is in the heart of Seattle and walkable to all the best Seattle has to offer. In any urban core, you can expect to hear street noise, often late into the evening.

There is a 2 chair, micro Hair Salon that operates above the apartment space daily from 9-9.

       "25    To be clear, this building has a seasonal, portable A/C unit. (almost NO buildings - less than 5% - in Seattle have central air conditioning).  Also, be aware that this is a urban environment. This condo is in the heart of Seattle and walkable to all the best Seattle has to offer. In any urban core, you can expect to hear street noise, often late into the evening.

       "8435  I'll reiterate that this is a shared accommodation. You will be sharing the common areas with the guest from room #2 (if booked) as well as with my friend who's an engineer for Microsoft (lives on the 1st floor). However, you will find that a lot of the time you may be lucky enough to have the space to yourself.  You may use the kitchen for light meal prep, but please clean up after yourself. Please remember to rinse your dishes and put them in the dishwasher after use.  Guests staying 5 or more days will be entitled to 1 load of laundry for every 5 days. For guests with shorter stays, a full load of laundry will incur $5 fee (water and power are expensive in Seattle) Please leave the room as you found it. This is my home, not a hotel, so please don't trash it :( I am excited to share my home with you; I will do my best to make your stay in Seattle a memorable one! :)                                                                                                                           \n",

If a silent outdoor environment is important to you, downtown Seattle (or any big city for that matter) may not be the best place for you to stay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "8435  Sound Transit's Route 560 will get you from the airport to West Seattle in about 20ish minutes (for $2.75). The bus drops you off 0.5 miles away from my house so you can either walk the remaining half a mile, take a cheap uber, or catch the the 120 bus that will drop you right in front of the house. An Uberpool to or from the airport can be anywhere between $10 - $20ish depending on time of day. Right across the street from the house is a bus stop where you can catch the 120 that takes you straight into seattle (about 20 - 30 minutes). An all day unlimited bus pass will run you about $8, or you can opt to pay $2.75/trip. There is ample free street parking on the streets around my house. If you're a user of the car2go service, I tend to see a bunch of those parked near my house so that's another convenient option should you care for it. Driving guests are reminded to be conscious of street signs as there are parking restrictions during certain weekday hours.                                \n",

       "8448  If you’re flying into Seattle, the drive to my place from SeaTac Airport takes about 30 minutes, depending on traffic. I recommend taking Lyft or Uber, or you could rent a car.  A car isn’t really needed to get around Lower Queen Anne, though - this area is a walker’s paradise. If you’re going Downtown, my place is just a 20-minute walk from the heart of Downtown Seattle and Pike Place Market. Not in the mood to walk? Hop on the monorail and be there in about 10. The Seattle Center Monorail leaves from Seattle Center Station (next to the Space Needle, a 5-minute walk from the apartment), and arrives at Westlake Center Station a few minutes later.

       "17    Your hosts are a pretty down-to-earth Lesbian couple in our 40s and our two children, ages 4 and 7 years old (who typically greet guests excitedly when they come home). I work at a community college as an ELL instructor and my wife works as an architectural designer. Our children will be eager to welcome you into our family while you're here, so a love of kids is a must. You'd share the common areas of the house with us. There is a shared bathroom, a kitchen with a gas stove, and a washer/dryer in the basement (where there is also room for bike storage). We're pretty mellow, yet we enjoy being social and host occasional dinner parties. If we have one while you're here, we hope you'll stick around and meet some great new people!  Because we have young children, we ask that no unauthorized guests be brought into the house without prior permission.   \n",

       "8435  Though this is a shared accomodation, my interaction with guests can be as little or as much as desired (I respect your privacy). As your host, your comfort is my priority, so if there is ever anything you need from me during your stay (e.g. food recommendations etc.. ), I'd be more than happy to chat with you. I live just up the street but you can easily reach me via call, text, email or through the airbnb app. I will also make an effort to stop by and greet you at some point during the day of your check-in (unless of course I'm out of town.) You may also occasionally see me doing some housekeeping in the house during your stay. I'm pretty easy going and would be happy to chat with ya.                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "5     Dear Prospective Guest,   There aren’t really many house rules.  Basically, come in and make yourself at home.  There’s no such thing as a check-in time that’s too late, so no worries there.  Let me know if you'd like an earlier check-in time than 3pm or later check-out time than noon.  It can usually be arranged, depending on other bookings.  Worst case scenario, we can store your luggage. All the food and drinks in your private little food alcove are complimentary, so help yourself to what's been called The World’s First Free Mini Bar.   The building is concrete, which means it’s pretty soundproof, so you don’t need to be shy about the volume of music or TV – just keep it moderate after 10pm.   Hold onto the keys and, if you drive, return the parking permit when you check out.  The lobby key fob has a $50 replacement cost imposed by the homeowners association that I must pass on to you, should you lose it.  With that in mind, no one has ever lost one in 16 years, so I’m pretty confid   \n",
